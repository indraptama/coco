# Why Should Organic Coconut Sugar
Coconut sugar (also called coconut palm sugar ) has become a popular alternative to white sugar due to its flavor and perceived health benefits. It’s also viewed as being unrefined ,much more natural, or less highly processed, than table sugar.

It is natural made from coconut sap, which is the sugary circulating fluid of the coconut plant.
 
Coconut sugar is made in 2 natural steps process : 
1.	A cut is made on the flower bud of the coconut palm and the liquid sap called neera is collected in to the containers, twice a day by the farmers. 
2.	The neera then is placed under heat until most of the water has evaporated. As the water evaporates, it starts to transform in to the thick syrup-like substance. From this form it is further reduced to crystal.

During the process, from the liquid sap till granulated coconut sugar, there is no other ingredient or chemical added at all. Hence everything is natural and unrefined.
