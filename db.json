    "title": "Why should organic Coconut sugar?",
    "body": "<p>Coconut sugar (also called coconut palm sugar ) has become a popular alternative to white sugar due to its flavor and perceived health benefits. It’s also viewed as being unrefined ,much more natural, or less highly processed, than table sugar.</p><p>It is natural made from coconut sap, which is the sugary circulating fluid of the coconut plant.</p><p>Coconut sugar is made in 2 natural steps process:</p><ul><li>a cut is made on the flower bud of the coconut palm and the liquid sap called neera is collected in to the containers, twice a day by the farmers.</li><li>The neera then is placed under heat until most of the water has evaporated. As the water evaporates, it starts to transform in to the thick syrup-like substance. From this form  it is further reduced to crystal.</li></ul><p>During the process, from the liquid sap till granulated coconut sugar, there is no other ingredient or chemical added at all. Hence everything is natural and unrefined.</p>"
